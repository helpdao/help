# HelpDAO TL;DR:

HelpDAO aims to launch local squads that **help vulnerable groups** in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

HelpDAO provides the software and the documentation for people to create local **help squads**.

Help squads take the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.

Help squads are composed of **donors**, **volunteers** and **supervisors**.

Help squads must have a **scope**, which is comprised of:

- **Demographic**: E.g. *People over 80 year old who live alone*
- **Location**: E.g. *Crimea*
- **Care actions**: E.g. *Deliver non-perishable food*

**Donors** donate money to a help squad. They receive a membership token which:

- Serves as recognition for their contribution
- Allows them to join the chat group of the help squad

**Volunteers** then carry out the tasks within the scope of the help squad. They can claim reimbursements by providing proof in the chat.

**Supervisors** are active members (likely donors) who verify that the volunteers have indeed completed their tasks. Supervisors can also nominate and remove volunteers.

While there is no way to cryptographically verify that volunteers and supervisors have indeed fulfilled their commitments, we anticipate social proof to come into force. The *social identity* of all supervisors and volunteers will be public, and donors can determine if they are comfortable with them based on their previous track-record of doing social good and being responsible members of their communities.

We need:

- Users to be able to deposit money into the DAO using their credit card
- Users to be able to get their membership token and store it somewhere
- Users to join the help squad's Telegram chat after they donate
- Volunteers to be able to cash out their Dai into their local currency or bank account

**Once multiple squads are set up** and working, HelpDAO could start a **global fundraiser**.

With that global fundraiser, the DAO can then choose **which local help squads need funding**.

That way, help squads can tap into a **pool of global capital**.

**Example**: An American may not know how bad the situation is in Italy, but thanks to donating to HelpDAO, she will be helping to allocate resources towards vulnerable Italian people.
